What problem is CI solving?

CI insures that our build is being built how we expect. CI will allow is to run all of our tests and be sure they are passing before we push our code out to production. CI also can ensure our team is maintaining the same standards by inforcing things like code quality and test coverage. Basically our CI allows us to deploy our app with piece of mind that the new deploy shouldnt crash our production app.

How is CI solving this problem?

CI solves these problems by running a series of tasks we set up to ensure these issues are checked and if the issue is not to our standards or failing we can reject the build.

Why do we want to set this up in a project as early as possible?

We want to set this up early to ensure all the code we deploy follows this system as well as we start with these habits. Also it is alot easier to add CI and these tools before the code base is large.

What are the trade off between automatic and manual deployment?

Automatic deployment allows us to que a series of tasks and walk away as everything is ran for us. The downside to automatic deployment is that if we expect something to work one way and it doesn't we will have to go in manually to fix it.

How will this affect your git flow and release process?

This will affect the git flow by adding tooling to commits can increase load times. CI can also be changed to only run when you merge into certain branches as to avoid long waits on every commit. CI will allow us as a team piece of mind we are mainting code quality and test coverage as well as that our app is being deployed the same way without bugs each time.
