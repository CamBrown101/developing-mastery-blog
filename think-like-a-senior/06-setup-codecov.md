What is a reasonable percentage coverage to maintain?

- I think depending on the team and the project that 80% is a good percent to shoot for. After this has been the goal for awhile then I would increase this. This way your team is not being sunk by writting tests and allows them to get familiar with testing and get quicker and writting tests.

Does 100% coverage mean you project is 100% test? why?

- No, maybe not all of your dependencies have proper test coverage. Maybe your code has all been "covered" by tests but not in every interaction your code has with a specific piece of code.

What impact do you think this would have on team culture?

- I think to start there is a learning curve to writting tests. In my experience the developers are eager to write more tests and the marketing and non technical people are the ones not allowing the dev team enough time to write tests. I think after the initial chunk of tests are written though it becomes part of the workflow to write tests and it becomes much easier. Also saves the team a ton of time fixing uncaught bugs and allows the team to move forward without fear they have broken something.
